## Installation

---

First, you'll need to `git clone` the repo to your local machine. After that you will need to run `npm i` in the repo in order to install the necessary packages. From there you will need to run the `schema.sql` file located in the db folder in either your `mysql` workbench or your `shell` in order for the database to load properly. You can also use the `seed.sql` file there to prefill the database if you so choose. From there just add your `.env` file with the necessary information and you are good to go!

## Usage

---

The only thing you'll need to do is just make sure you are in repo on your local machine and then run `node index.js` to kickstart the program. From there the program will give easy to follow questions that you can answer with the appropriate information.
